## Project Aim

To develop an Excel dashboard that provides insights into the factors that influence bike sales, such as marital status, gender, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership, cars, commute distance, region, and age

## Skills Learned

Learned how to use Excel to clean and organize data. I used filtering and sorting to remove duplicate data and identify trends. I then created a pivot table to summarize the data and create charts to visualize the results. This information can be used to make decisions about a variety of projects.
